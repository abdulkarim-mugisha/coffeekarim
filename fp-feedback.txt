1. What is your estimated grade for the Final Project (roughly of 100)? For partner projects,
   do you think the workload distribution was fair?

A 95. I have a few incomplete (unpolished) features and functionalities. 

2. What is your estimated grade for the course (letter grade)? You can support your
   estimate with examples of demonstrated engagement in the course material, strengths
   (and weaknesses) over the term, and growth throughout the material (some assignment
   grading feedback was delayed, but we would like to know what resources you used to
   iterate on the material, such as lectures, OH, Discord, etc.)

A. I engaged alot with the assignments of the course (especially the CPs), making it a point
to learn as much as I can from the provided resources to produce the best sites I could, and I
think they turned out very nice. I have learnt a lot from this term from almost zero 
web dev knowledge to a good working proficiency. 

3. To what extent would you like feedback in your project (e.g. thorough, particular areas of the
   project, or just a grade)?

I would like feedback on the user friendliness of the site. I doesn't have to be too thorough, just 
a few bullet point suggestions of areas of improvement if any because I may continue building on the 
project.

4. Anything else you would like El to know when grading?

I was partnering with Eden (eobengky@caltech.edu) for the backend, but we had
different visions for the front end for both data and some endpoints so we split 
the project to tailor make our backends for our individual purposes. 

5. Are you open to sharing your project/reflection for future terms? If so, would you
   like named credit or anonymous?

Yes, anonymous.
